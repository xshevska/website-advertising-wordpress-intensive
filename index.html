                There are countless active and even abandoned sites on the Internet. Most of them are the same not only by category, but also by content. 
                <br><br>
                Imagine thousands of sites that in one way or another provide the same information or sell the same service. And these sites can only be accessed by subject queries in search engines. 
                <br><br>
                But what should you do if your site is like a hundred or a thousand of them, and one page of google or yandex only 10 positions? How to bring visitors to the page of your resource? This is exactly what optimization is for - to get your site on the first page of search! 
                <br><br>
                 <span>We will teach you how to make your site attractive to search engines and advise you how to bring it to the first page, bypassing all competitors.</span>
